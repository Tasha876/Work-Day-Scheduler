## 1. Description
This is a very basic planner that you can use to plan your day.

#### Note:
I changed the look of the planner, because I didn't like the original styling.

### Summary of Functionality

* You can store agenda items into the planner by either cloicking on the checkmark, or by pressing enter after you are done typing in the text field.
* the style of each time slot is updated depending on whether the event is in the past, present or future.

## 5. Next steps
This is a very basic planner and several features could be added, some of these include (but are in no way limited to):
- the ability to add items that are either less than or more than 1 hour
- the ability to add descriptions to each event
- the ability to add to more than one day
- the ability to add events to hours outside of the workday, but still have the next set of workday hours be on focus when the planner is first opened
- better UI possibly including a datk mode
